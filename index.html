            <!-- Text Content -->
            <p>Hi, I’m Prisha! I split my time between California and New York, and cars have been a lifelong passion of mine. From a young age, I was drawn to the artistry and engineering behind automobiles, whether it was admiring classic models at museums, getting my hands dirty working on engines, or organizing car shows to bring enthusiasts together.</p>

            <p>My experience ranges from preserving automotive history at car museums to hands-on mechanical work, where I love fine-tuning engines and understanding what makes each car unique. I’ve also had the opportunity to run car shows, curating collections that highlight both vintage icons and modern innovations.</p>

            <p>For me, cars are more than just machines. They tell stories, evoke emotions, and represent the perfect blend of design and performance. Through my work, I aim to celebrate the culture and craftsmanship of the automotive world while connecting with fellow enthusiasts who share the same passion.</p>
